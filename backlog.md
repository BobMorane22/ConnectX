## (24-01-2021) Handle Github deprecation notice.

I recently have gotten some messages from GitHub asking me to update the way I access the
repository. The way I am working right now will no longer be working at GitHub soon:

  > Hi @BobMorane22,
  > 
  > You recently used a password to access the repository at
  > BobMorane22/connectx with git using git/2.17.1.
  > 
  > Basic authentication using a password to Git is deprecated and will soon no longer work.
  > Visit https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/
  > for more information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.
  > 
  > Thanks,
  > The GitHub Team

Th removal date is August 13, 2021.
